// 2.8 Increment and Decrement Operators

++ <- // increment by 1
-- <- //decrement by 1

// Prefixxed vs suffixed 
++n - increments 1 before n 
n++ - increments n after

//2.9 Bitwise Operators
& <-- //Bitwise AND
| <-- //Bitwise OR

//Different from
// && --> Simply evaluates a comparison if its true
// || --> Same with AND but for OR 

//Shift operators
// >> << performs shifts of their left operand
// << this means for a left shift which shifts the bits to a number to the left
//In other words, << means that you will multiply it by 2 depending on the value
//Ex: 30 << 2 = 30 x 2^2 = 120

// >> Means a right shift which shifts it to the specified amount
//in other words, 30 >> 2 = 30 / 2squared  since a right shift denotes
// a division

//Unary operator
// Yields the one's complement of an integer
//Ex: x = x & ~077
