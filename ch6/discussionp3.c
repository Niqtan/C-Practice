//6.6 Lookup Tables

#define IN 1

state = IN; //IN becomes 1 because of the replacement text

//Two functions which manipulate this behavior:

//install(s,t) 
//Records name s and replacement text t

//Lookup(s) searches for s in table

//hash function adds a hash value of string s





//6.7 Typedef

typedef int Length;
//Makes the name length syonym for an integer
//Can be used in declarations, casts, and 

Length *lengths[];

typedef char *String; 
//char gets replaced by a data type called String
//Makes a data type for string


typedef int INTEGER;

int main() {
    INTEGER var = 100;
     
}

//typedef on structures
typedef struct car {
}
car

int main() {
    car c1;
    
}
